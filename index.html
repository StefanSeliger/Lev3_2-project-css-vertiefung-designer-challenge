            <h2>Every idea <img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="light bulp" id="ideaIcon"> starts with a need</h2>
            <p class="pType1">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design
                skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes
                more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did
                not solve any problem.</p>

                    <p class="pType1">As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t

                        perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
